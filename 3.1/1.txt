Running: The process is actively executing and using CPU resources.

Blocked (Waiting): The process is unable to execute due to some condition, such as waiting for a resource, waiting for user input, or waiting for I/O to complete.

Ready: The process is ready to run but is currently not executing because the CPU is allocated to another process. It is waiting in the queue to be scheduled for execution.

Terminated (Exited): The process has finished executing its task and has been terminated. It is no longer running and has released its resources.

Stopped (Suspended): The process has been stopped, usually by a user or another process, and is not allowed to execute until it is explicitly resumed. This is often used for debugging or managing processes.
